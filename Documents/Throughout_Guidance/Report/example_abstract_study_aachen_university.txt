Abstract—IEEE 802.15.4 was developed to meet the needs for
simple, low-power and low-cost wireless communication. In the
past couple of years it has become a popular technology for
wireless sensor networks. It operates primarily in the 2.4 GHz
ISM band, which makes the technology easily applicable and
worldwide available. However, IEEE 802.15.4 is potentially vulnerable
to interference by other wireless technologies working in
this band such as IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth. This paper gives
a short overview of the IEEE 802.15.4 and carefully analyzes
the properties and performance of IEEE 802.15.4 through measurement
of the RSSI, PER and run lengths distribution using
real off-the-shelf hardware. Furthermore we present simulation
results from the evaluation of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol.
Finally, we address the coexistence between IEEE 802.11 and
IEEE 802.15.4 and measure the impact these two wireless
technologies have on each other when operating concurrently
and in range.
